Hey claude, I'm giving a talk about some of our experiences building Claude Code.
The talk content is talk.md
Can you help me make a little bun server that will serve up each part of this outline as a separate html page? Make it so I can use left and right arrows to move through the presentation. Use your judgement about how to break things up, but aim for no more than 5 lines of text on a slide. Install some packages to render markdown to html.
